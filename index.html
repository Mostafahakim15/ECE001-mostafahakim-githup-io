Programming languages are not very different from spoken languages. Learning any language requires an understanding of the building blocks and the grammar that govern the construction of statements in that language. this page serve as an introduction to programming languages, taking you through the history of programming languages. We will also learn about the various universal properties of all programming languages and identify distinct design features of each programming language.
To build a software program, a programming language is a series of commands, instructions, and other syntax uses. Languages used by programmers to write code are called "high-level languages," which can be compiled into a "low-level language" that is directly recognized by the computer hardware.High level languages are designed for fast reading and comprehension. This helps programmers to automatically write source code, use logical words and symbols. For example, in most major programming languages, reserved words like function are used while, if and otherwise. Symbols as <, >, = =, and! Usual operators are =.Many high-level languages are similar enough that programmers can easily understand source code written in multiple languages.High-level languages for example include C++, Java , Perl and PHP. Languages such as C++ and Java are called "compiled languages," since the source code must be compiled for running first. Languages such as Perl and PHP are considered "interpreted languages" because the source code can be executed without compiling an interpreter.Generally, compiled languages are used to create software applications, while interpreted languages are used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.
Assembly and computer languages are included in the low-level languages. A language of assembly includes a set of simple instructions, which is much harder to read than a language of high level. In rare cases, a programmer may decide to code a basic program in a language of assembly to ensure that it works as efficiently as possible.
The assembly code can be translated into computer code using an assembler. The machine code, or machine language, contains a series of binary codes which a computer's CPU understands directly. It goes without saying that the computer language is not built to be readable by humans.
