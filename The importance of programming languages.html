Computers profoundly affect modern human life. And a computer program powers the machine. Computer programs are arranged by programming languages, therefore they are the basis of all the conveniences that we feel. Programming languages are responsible for all programs made; listing systems, virtual reality, scheduling tools, online games, the Uber app, anti-virus and so on.
 Thus mastering programming languages brings one closer to understanding how all digital technology originates. This article will highlight the importance of programming languages.
 Programming languages refer to various types of expressions and logical rules of structuring that generate recurring and systematic tasks. They are of great importance because they allow the generation of various systems that serve tasks that satisfy users ' needs. There is a wide range of these languages and they are in any case tailored to various types of requirements;this plurality can be divided into two large groups, structured programming languages ​​and object-oriented languages. Almost everything we can use in computer science is largely due to programming languages.

A computer allows high speed calculation operations; however, if it was not for the programs running on it, it is totally unusable. These programs are of different kinds, with perhaps the most important of all, the operating system, the system on which the various applications run. In order to improve the programming languages,Each one of which has specific features for its implementation. Additionally, every programming language is written at a lower level in turn, allowing for a multitude of responses to established needs. In other words, every program is built in a simple flow;Simple solutions are followed by more complex solutions, and so on, in line with evolving needs. It's worth noting that every discipline comes from a basic understanding, so does the programming languages research.As we said, there are two large groups of programming languages, those with structured programming and the object-oriented ones. In the first example, the language consists of a set of instructions and orders as well as a set of laws for their application; in this example, the propositional logic plays a central role and all operations may be subjected to logical relations.
On the other hand, in the case of an object-oriented programming language, there is an intention to reflect different circumstances of real existence in the language; thus, reference will be made to objects , classes, inheritances, attributes etc. Programming languages can also be split between interpreted languages and the languages compiled; in the first case the language must be interpreted by another program, while in the second case it must be translated by means of a compiler, creating in the process a file that is called executable.
The knowledge of some programming language can be very important to develop capacities in terms of problem solving and task automation. Certainly this type of knowledge coupled with some basic notions of algorithms can open a whole new panorama of job possibilities
The importance of programming language training in Serbia's schools and colleges. The main purpose of programming languages is to create various types of applications that will assist people in their normal activities. Based on various factors, which programming language should be learned.
