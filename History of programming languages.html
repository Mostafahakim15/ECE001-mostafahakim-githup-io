Since Charles Babbage 's invention of the differential engine in 1822, computers have required a means to instruct them to perform a specific task. This means the programming language is known as. Computer languages were composed initially of a series of steps to wire a particular program;
These morphed into a series of steps keyed in the computer and then executed; later those languages acquired advanced features such as logical branching and object orientation. In the last fifty years, the computer languages have come in two stages, the first major languages and the second major languages, which are in use today.
In the beginning the difference engine of Charles Babbage could only be made to perform tasks by changing the gears that performed the calculations. While physical motion was the earliest type of a machine language. Eventually, when the US Government installed the ENIAC in 1942, physical motion was replaced by electrical signals.
It followed many of the same principles of Babbage’s engine and hence, could only be “programmed” by presetting switches and rewiring the entire system for each new “program” or calculation. This process proved to be very tedious.
John Von Neumann was employed at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1945. He developed two important concepts that directly affected computer language programming paths. The first was known as the "technique of shared software" (www.softlord.com). This technique indicated that the actual hardware of the computer should be simple and not hand-wired for each program.Instead, the simple hardware should be managed with complex instructions, allowing it to be reprogrammed much quicker.
The second concept was also extremely important for programming language development. Von Neumann called it a 'conditional transfer of control' (www.softlord.com). This idea gave rise to the notion of subroutines or small blocks of code that in any order could be jumped to,Instead of doing a single set of chronologically ordered computer steps. The second part of the idea stated that computer code can be branched on the basis of logical statements
A few years after the work of Von Neumann the language Short Code appeared in 1949 (www.byte.com). It was the first computer language for electronic devices and required a manual change of the programmer's statements into 0s and 1s. It was, still, the first step towards today's complex languages. Grace Hopper had written the first compiler in 1951,A compiler is a program that turns the language’s statements into 0’s and 1’s for the computer to understand. This lead to faster programming, as the programmer no longer had to do the work by hand.
The first of the major languages appeared in FORTRAN form in 1957. Its name stands for machine FORmula TRANslating. The language for scientific computation was conceived at IBM. The components were very simple, and gave the programmer low-level access to the inner computers.
In 1958 MIT 's John McCarthy invented the language LISt Processing (or LISP). It was created for research into Artificial Intelligence ( AI). The original release of LISP had a unique syntax, because it was designed for a specialized field: essentially none. Programmers wrote code in parse trees, which are usually an intermediary between higher syntax created by compilers (such as in C or Java) and lower-level code.
In 1958, the Algol language was created by a scientific usage committee. The root of the tree that has led to such languages as Pascal, C , C++, and Java is the major contribution. It was also the first language with a formal grammar, known as the Backus-Naar Type or BNF (McGraw-Hill Science and Technology Encyclopaedia, 454).Although Algol implemented some novel concepts, such as recursive function calling, the next language version, Algol 68, became bloated and difficult to use. This leads to the adoption of smaller, more compact languages , for example Pascal.
Pascal was started by Niklaus Wirth in 1968. Its development was largely out of necessity for a good teaching tool In the beginning language designers had no hope that it would enjoy broad adoption. Instead, they concentrated on developing good teaching tools such as a debugger and editing program, and supporting popular early microprocessor machines used in educational institutions.
A modern form of programming was being developed during the late 1970s and early 1980s. This became known as OOP, or Object Oriented Programming. Objects are pieces of data which the programmer can package and manipulate. Bjarne Stroustroup liked this approach and created C extensions known as "C With Classes," which evolved into the full-featured C++ language, which was released in 1983.Interactive television became the technology of the future in the early 1990's. Sun Microsystems decided that a different, portable (can run on many types of machines), language was required for interactive TV. Eventually, that language became Java. The Java project team turned their attention to the web in 1994 which became "the hip thing" after interactive television failed. The following year,Netscape licensed Java for use in their internet browser.
Programming languages have been under development for years and will remain so for many years to come. They got their start with a list of steps to wire a computer to perform a task. These steps eventually found their way into software and began to acquire newer and better features.
