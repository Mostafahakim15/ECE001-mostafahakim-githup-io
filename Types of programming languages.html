    <h3>java</h3>
	Java is a programming language of high quality developed by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed to create programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, but was later a common option for web application development.
	The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly a programming language oriented towards objects. For instance, most Java programs contain classes used to identify objects, and methods assigned to individual classes. Java is also known to be more stringent than C++, which means that the variables and functions must be defined explicitly. This means that Java source code will cause errors, or"exceptions" more easily than other languages, but it also limits other types of errors that may be caused by undefined variables or unassigned types.
	Unlike Windows executables (.EXE files) or Macintosh applications (.APP files), Java programs are not run directly by the operating system. Instead, Java programs are interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, which runs on multiple platforms. This means all Java programs are multiplatform and can run on different platforms, including Macintosh, Windows, and Unix computers.For Java applications or applets to run at all, the JVM must be enabled however. Thankfully the JVM is used as part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which can be downloaded free of charge. 

NOTE: Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle in January 2010 But now Oracle manages and distributes Java.
     <h3>python</h3> 
	 Python is a programming language of high quality built to be easy to read and quick to implement. It is open source, meaning it can be used freely, including for commercial applications. Python can run on Mac , Windows, and Unix systems and has been ported to virtual machines Java and .NET as well.
	 Python, like Ruby or Perl, is considered a scripting language and is often used to create Web applications and dynamic Web content. A number of 2D and 3D imaging programs also support it, which allow users to create custom plug-ins and extensions with Python. GIMP, Inkscape, Blender, and Autodesk Maya are examples of applications which support a Python API.Python-written scripts (.PY files) can be parsed and instantly run. They can also be saved as compiled programs (.PYC files), which are often used as programming modules which other Python programs may reference.
	 <h3>c++</h3> 
	 C is a programming language of high quality that was established in the mid-1970s. It was initially used to write Unix programs but is now used to write software for almost any platform available. C is simpler to read, more versatile (can be used for a wide range of purposes) than most previous languages, and more easy to use memory.C++, pronounced "C plus plus" is a language of programming built from the C language. The C++ syntax is almost identical to C, but it does have object-oriented features that allow the programmer to create objects within the code. This makes programming easier, more efficient and even more fun for some to say. Because of the power and flexibility of the language, most software programs today are written in C++.
